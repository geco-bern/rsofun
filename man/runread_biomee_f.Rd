\title{Run BiomeE}
\usage{
runread_biomee_f(drivers, makecheck = TRUE, parallel = FALSE, ncores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{drivers}{A nested data frame with one row for each site and columns
named according to the arguments of function \code{\link{run_biomee_f_bysite}}.
Namely \code{sitename, params_siml, site_info} and \code{forcing}.}

\item{makecheck}{A logical specifying whether checks are performed 
to verify forcings and model parameters. \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{parallel}{Deprecated. Use ncores instead.}

\item{ncores}{An integer specifying the number of cores used for parallel 
computing (sites processed in parallel). Default: 1 (no parallel execution).}
}
\value{
A data frame (tibble) with one row for each site.
The columns are the site information \code{site_info} and one column per land unit (LU) in addition to an aggregated output \code{aggregated}.
By default, the only LU is named \code{data} and \code{aggregated} is not present since aggregating one LU is not useful.
When multiple LU are configured (using \code{init_lu}), the columns are named using the LU name provided in \code{init_lu}.
See \code{\link{run_biomee_f_bysite}} for a detailed description of the outputs.
Example outputs are provided as \code{\link{biomee_p_model_output}} and \code{\link{biomee_p_model_luluc_output}}.
