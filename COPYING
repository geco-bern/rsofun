Model code for BiomeE (Fortran modules datatypes.mod.f90, vegetation_biomee.mod.f90, soil_biomee.mod.f90) are written by Ensheng Weng and are adapted from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7125963.

Model code for SPLASH (Fortran modules waterbal_splash_pmodel.mod.f90, waterbal_splash_cnmodel.mod.f90) and P-model (parts of Fortran module photosynth_pmodel.mod.f90) are partly based on Python code by Tyler Davis (published under GPL2.1) and are adapted from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.376293.

Model code for interactive C-N cycling (parts of Fortran modules littersom.mod.f90, ntransform.mod.f90, phenology_lpx.mod.f90, soiltemp_sitch.mod.f90) are adapted from LPX-Bern.
