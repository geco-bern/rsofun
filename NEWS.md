# rsofun 5.1.0

## New features

* Added support for LULUC (land use, land-use change) in BiomeE. See vignette `biome_luluc` for details.
* New BiomeE behavior to recycle last year of forcing if requested simulation time span (`nyeartrend`) is longer than 
available forcing data.

## Breaking changes

* Breaking changes in biomee drivers:
  * `init_cohort$init_n_cohorts` column has been phased out and must not be present in  
drivers to protect against data corruption.
  * `update_annualLAImax` flag was removed and the behavior is now slightly altered since `LAImax` and `underLAImax` are set and kept constant at the start of the simulation:
    * `LAImax` takes value `max(LAI_light, 0.5)`
    * `underLAImax` takes value `min(LAImax, 1.2)`
  * `do_closedN_run` flag now uses initial inorganic N setting rather than arbitrary value and is false by default.
  * Modified drivers to use more sensibles values
    * Species 1 is now a C4 crop
    * `N_input` is set to 0.01 to limit N starvation.

* Breaking changes in biomee output
  * renamed the following column names in `output_daily_tile`:
    * `totWs`=>`SoilWater`
    * `Trsp`=>`Transp`
    * `SW_C`=>`sapwoodC` and `SW_N`=>`sapwoodN`
    * `HW_C`=>`heartwoodC` and `HW_N`=>`heartwoodN`
    * `McrbC`=>`mcrbC` and `McrbN`=>`mcrbN`
    * added `NPP`
  * renamed the following column names in `output_annual_tile` and `output_annual_cell`:
    * `rain`=>`Prcp`
    * `SeedC`=>`seedC` (and for `N`)
    * `SapwoodC`=>`sapwoodC` (and for `N`)
    * `WoodC`=>`heartwoodC` (and for `N`)
    * `SlowSOM`=>`slowSOM`
    * `McrbC`=>`mcrbC` and `McrbN`=>`mcrbN`
    * added `totC`
  * renamed the following column names in `output_annual_cohorts`:
    * `nsc`=>`NSC` and `nsn`=>`NSN` 
    * `sapwC`=>`sapwoodC`
    * `woodC`=>`heartwoodC`
    * `Nupt`=>`N_uptk`
    * `Nfix`=>`N_fxed`
    * switched column positions of `NPP` and `GPP`
